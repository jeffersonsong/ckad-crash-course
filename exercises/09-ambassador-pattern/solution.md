In this example, you'll be asked to implement rate-limiting functionality for HTTP(S) calls to an external service. For example, the requirements for the rate limiter could say that an application can only make a maximum of five calls every 15 minutes. Instead of strongly coupling the rate-limiting logic to the application code, it will be provided by an ambassador container.

The image `bmuschko/nodejs-business-app:1.0.0` represents a Node.js-based application that makes a call to localhost on port 8081. The ambassador container represented by the image `bmuschko/nodejs-ambassador:1.0.0` running on port 8081 will take on making the HTTP call to the external service while at the same time enforcing rate limiting.

> [!NOTE]
> If you do not already have a cluster, you can create one by using minikube or you can use the O'Reilly interactive lab ["Implementing the Ambassador Pattern"](https://learning.oreilly.com/scenarios/implementing-the-ambassador/9781098163945/).

1. Create a YAML manifest for a Pod with the name `rate-limiter` in the namespace `ext-access`. Store the definition in the file named `rate-limiter.yaml`. The main application container named `business-app` should use the image `bmuschko/nodejs-business-app:1.0.0` and expose the container port 8080.

k create ns ext-access
namespace/ext-access created

2. Modify the YAML manifest by adding the ambassador container named `ambassador`. The ambassador container uses the image `bmuschko/nodejs-ambassador:1.0.0` and exposes the container port 8081.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: rate-limiter
  namespace: ext-access
spec:
  containers:
  - image: bmuschko/nodejs-business-app:1.0.0
    name: business-app
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8080
  - image: bmuschko/nodejs-ambassador:1.0.0
    name: ambassador
    ports:
    - containerPort: 8081
  restartPolicy: Never
```

```shell
k apply -f rate-limiter.yaml 
pod/rate-limiter created

k get po -n ext-access -w          
NAME           READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
rate-limiter   2/2     Running   0          88s
```

3. Test the rate-limiting functionality. First, create the Pod, shell into the `business-app` container that runs the business application, and execute a series of `curl` commands that target `localhost:8081/test`, the end point of the `ambassador` container. The first five calls will be allowed to the external service. On the sixth call, youâ€™ll receive an error message, as the rate limit has been reached within the given time frame.

```shell
k exec -it rate-limiter -n ext-access -c business-app -- /bin/sh

# curl http://localhost:8081/test
```
```json
{
  "args": {
    "test": "undefined"
  },
  "headers": {
    "host": "postman-echo.com",
    "x-forwarded-proto": "http",
    "x-request-start": "t=1725242560.048",
    "connection": "close",
    "x-forwarded-port": "443",
    "x-amzn-trace-id": "Root=1-66d51cc0-3ad4c08e7cd9e55d72d1cc1a"
  },
  "url": "http://postman-echo.com/get?test=undefined"
}
```

```shell
# curl http://localhost:8081/test
# curl http://localhost:8081/test
# curl http://localhost:8081/test
# curl http://localhost:8081/test

# curl http://localhost:8081/test
